# MaireAcademie

## What is this?
This is a project a colleague and I worked on back when [Laval's mayor was in hot waters](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/06/28/laval_mayor_i_never_received_anything_of_a_sexual_nature.html) and [Montreal's mayor was also in hot waters](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2013/06/18/montreal-mayor-michael-applebaum-arrested-charged-fraud.html).

The purpose of this project was to let people vote for their cities in a Star Academie kind of way.
We wanted to play around with express.js, CoffeeScript, NodeJS and add some Twilio on top of it.

We built this in a day, but were still kind of late to the party - the project did not really attract too much traffic.

Anyway, here's the code for it, in case you want to do something similar.
